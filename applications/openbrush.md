# W3F Open Grant Proposal

* **Project Name:** OpenBrush
* **Team Name:** [SuperColony](https://github.com/Supercolony-net)
* **Payment Address:** ERC 20 ADDRESS:
0x112C9eDB60D16f9Cf501721b03B9D0F275682213

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:
https://github.com/w3f/PSPs/pull/22

### Overview
Our mission with this project is to make ink! usable and achieve its wide adoption.

In order to be successful with this mission several steps need to be taken. 
1. OpenBrush is open source library for secure smart-contract development on ink! as
[OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts) on Solidity.

2. Openbrush should serve as a starting point for every developer entering a Polkadot(ink!) ecosystem. 
3. In addition to having a standard implementation Openbrush should also have macroses to simplify and abstract up applications(smart contracts) development,
4. In order for Openbrush to work and fulfill it's purpose several changes must be made/several blockers overcome in `ink!` and substrate's `contract-pallet`. We are commited to do that in the context of this project.

This project is important to us as it's our strategic goal to accelerate Polkadot ecosystem development. Applications on Ink! is a huge part of it. 

### Project Details
The open brush should be the starting point for smart contract developers from Ethereum. 
It will contain the same folder structure as openzeppelin and documentation that describes the differences 
between ink! and Solidity, how developers should change their mindset, how to design their project, 
how to deploy contract and test them, etc.

The library will provide the default implementation of standard contracts which 
can be customized by developers. Also, the library will provide additional 
features which are not available in ink!(and our team will try to integrate them into ink! later) 
but which can be useful for development.

Our team aims to improve the smart-contract development experience,
and wants to improve ink!, make it more user-friendly and to popularize it.

### Ecosystem Fit

* Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

A necessity of a solution like this seemed rather urgent to us when we started to work with ink!. We quikcly realized that we strategically would like to become the company that builds in the ecosystem. Decided that we want to take commitment and help ink! became widespread and used. Right now usability of ink! is very low. Openbrush is deicated towards changing that. 
  
* Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?

Our target audience are smart contract developers on ink!.

* What need(s) does your project meet?

Our project is starting point for smart contract developers coming from other ecosystems like Ethereum and it aims to improve smart contract development on ink!.

* Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
  
We know only about one project [metis](https://github.com/patractlabs/metis).

* If so, how is your project different?

Our project isn't restricted to only providing the base implementation of contracts.
Objectively speaking based on what we know, what we currently see and what was listed in their proposal here are key differences:
- At the moment Developer Experience of our library is significantly higher
- Openbrush aims to propose and take care of standards for ink! (We've already created [PSP](https://github.com/w3f/PSPs/pull/22) for fungible tokens and we plan to cotinue doing so)
- Openbrush aims to be an starting point for a smart contract developer, provide documentation.
- Contribute to ink! and substrate `contract-pallet` to improve the smart-contract development experience(add new features, fix bugs, etc).

**Lera Laricheva**  
Creative Designer  
"In 2019 I started to get involved in the IT area. At first I tried myself as a developer, and eventually I went away from that to design. At first I tried myself in design, then when I saw the result and understood that I liked it, I found courses and got a diploma. Then I tried freelancing, like many other beginners, but came to the conclusion that the work in the company is much better, and that is where a person can get a tremendous experience, always evolving, because you have to keep up with the tasks, and most importantly to understand them and try to implement them correctly. At the same time I’m studying the third year in Karazin, specialty marketing."

## Development Status :open_book:

[The project](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts) is already in progress.


## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We _recommend_ that the scope of the work can fit within a three-month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

* make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../src/grant_guidelines_per_category.md).
* include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
* include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
* provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
* commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
* indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
* **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Overview

* **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
* **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)
* **Total Costs:** Amount of payment in USD for the whole project. The total amount of funding _needs to be below $30k for initial grants_ and $100k for follow-up grants. (e.g. 12,000 USD). This and the costs for each milestone need to be in USD; if the grant is paid out in Bitcoin, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment.
